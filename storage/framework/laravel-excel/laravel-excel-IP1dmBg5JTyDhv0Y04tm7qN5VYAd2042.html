<p>The term &amp; concept related sustainability are clear &amp; easy to understand .</p>

<p>They help me to understand the meaning of sustainability , how to protect the environment and how to save the natural resources from many little things that we can do every day . For example : reduce plastic usage ; save the water ; limite shopping&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank to this course I can also understand the reasons and goals of why Easia Travel has embraced the concept of sustainability...</p>

<p>The clips are interesting, through which the course becomes more interactive and rememberable .</p>

<p>On the 11th question ,&nbsp;in the first attempts&nbsp; I had a mistake when I arrange the numbers in each cells because&nbsp;It requires to go in ascending order .</p>

<p>You should have a small remark for this part to clear the demanding of the test .</p>

<p>To be more specific:</p>

<p>the last two programs should match with 3 day angkor pass not well used because clients have only 2 days in Angkor instead of 3 days.</p>

<p>but with the program starting with the sunset admiration at BaKheng, the correct answer should be 7 day angkor pass needed well use while it has only 5 days in Angkor. I well understand that there is no 5 day Angkor pass but with this case 7 day Angkor pass is still not well used.</p>

<p>To sum up, I think that the requirement of this question should be clearer and if possibile, it should have some instructions to learners to choose the correct answers.</p></td>

<p>For example - &nbsp;Carbon footprint &ndash; what does it mean for tourism?<br />
A client can ask us the calculation of the carbon footprint of a tour ( vehicle &ndash; fuel consumption- &ldquo;type of fuel&rdquo; &nbsp;- In Europe the &ldquo; green fuel&rdquo; exists already , but not in Vietnam)</p>

<p>Or copy an email we have received from clients about specific request about sustainability&nbsp; ( ref carbon offset request on German market - client studiosus if I remenber) or French Market&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have much time to concentrate on learning the course.

I would advice if the there are 2 words with the same functions and meanings linking with the word &quot;and&quot;, please be flexible for the examinee to choose whichever come first and second, as long as it didn&#39;t change the meaning, structure of the origin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Some Travel Agencies or Tour Operators have an ____________ (1) and ______________ (2)&nbsp;with a team of&nbsp;experts&nbsp;taking care of the incentive requests only, or sometimes&nbsp;groups and incentives.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The correct answer: (1) Incentive Department, (2) Events department. However, if we exchange these words position, (1) Events Department and (2) Incentive Department, the sentence meaning does not change. It isn&#39;t neccesarily at exact order as in the lesson and so on. This is one of the example I think of.&nbsp;</p>
