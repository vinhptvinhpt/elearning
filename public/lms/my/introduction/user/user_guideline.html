            <p>Dear Easia Academy Trainee,</p>
            <p>During your time with us at Easia Travel, dependent upon your role and its required competencies will need to complete a number of online training courses. You will also have access to many optional courses that can be of benefit to your professional development.
               The following is some important information that you should know before you start any of the courses.
            </p>
         </div>
         <h4 class="mb-3" >Taking Notes</h4>
         <div>
            <p>As you are guided through each on-line course it is highly recommend that you take notes of the main points. This will help you in 3 ways.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Firstly, it is a scientifically proven fact that taking notes helps memory retention. The simple act of writing down main points greatly increases the chances of you being able to easily remember that information later.</li>
               <li>Secondly, as explained below, each course is completed with a test. Your notes can be referred to when you are taking the test.</li>
               <li>Finally, when the time comes for you to put your new knowledge into practice at work you can refer back to your notes to remind yourself of relevant required information.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <h4 class="mb-3" >Assessment of or Learning</h4>
         <div>
            <p>At the end of each course you will be required to complete an assessment (test) to demonstrate that you have met the requirements of the course and are now ready to put what you learned into practice.</p>
            <p>The course will lead you straight to the test, you simply need to follow the instructions.</p>
            <p>Your test will then be automatically checked and scored.</p>
            <p>Our pass rate for all tests at Easia Travel is 100%.</p>
            <p>If you do not receive 100% on your first attempt, you can take the test a second time.</p>
            <p>If you fail to achieve 100% on your second attempt, your supervisor / line-manager will be notified and counsel you about your knowledge gap before unlocking the test to enable you to make a 3rd attempt where it is then expected you can achieve the 100% pass rate.</p>
         </div>
         <h4 class="mb-3" >Digital Badges & Certificates</h4>
         <div>
            <p>Upon the successful completion of each course you will be issued with a digital badge and a certificate.</p>
            <p>The digital badge can used in your Workplace, Linked-In and similar social media profiles to publicly demonstrate your professional development.</p>
            <p>The certificate is located in your Easia Academy profile and can be downloaded and printed at any time you like.</p>
         </div>
         <h4 class="mb-3" >Course Survey</h4>
         <div>
            <p>At Easia Academy we are committed to the continuous improvement of all our online courses.</p>
            <p>But to do that we rely very much on the feedback of the people that actually do the course, i.e., you the online trainee.</p>
            <p>To facilitate this, at the end of each course, after you have passed the final test, you will be asked to give some feedback on how the course might be improved, or if any information was missing or seemed unclear to you. 
               Please do take the time to give accurate and relevant feedback so that others students like you can benefit from your ideas and observations.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>Again, congratulations on becoming a student of the Easia Academy and we wish you great success in your future studies with us.</p>
